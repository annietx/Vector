# Vector

This is a repo for all work in progress files for the Vector anthromoporism module.

## Files
* `pickup.py` will make Vector react first negatively to being picked up and then positively. It could be used as an example in part 1 of the module. the file `hi.wav` is required for execution.

* `cliff.py` will first make Vector drive toward the edge of a table (it should be positioned close to the edge) and then stop. Then, it will make Vector backup and do the same thing without stopping. If the user doesn't intervene Vector will fall. This was initially written for another module idea but could be adapted into an exmaple for part 1 of the module.

* `interactive_shell.py` is based example provided by anki. It opens up an iPython envionment and streams what Vector sees to the laptop. It now contained simplified wrappers over Vector functionality that students can call in the iPython environment.
